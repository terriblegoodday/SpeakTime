SpotlightActivator (iOS 11-12)
=========

Activator listener to reveal Spotlight (like the swipe down from status bar in iOS 10 did)

Big thanks to [@dunkston](https://github.com/dunkston) for the tweak [TapSpotlight](https://github.com/dunkston/TapSpotlight) which allows to reveal Spotlight by double tapping Home Bar.
